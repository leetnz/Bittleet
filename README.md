# Bittleet

A fork of [Petoi OpenCat](https://github.com/PetoiCamp/OpenCat) but only focusses on Bittle.

The motivation of `Bittleet` is to break the original `OpenCat` firmware into manageable chunks so that functionality can be extended without breaking other functionality.

This is a work in progress.

## Running Tests

Requires `g++` and `make`. Run tests with:

```
make test
```
